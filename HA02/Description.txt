
INPUT:
      format: input.py <numberOfPorts> <baseValueOfPorts> <bufferSize in bytes> <UDP port of switching fabric> <transmitRate>
      example: input.py 3 30000 5 5000 3

WORKING: The program uses concepts of socket programming to implement a simple multiple input port connections
           to obtain data. the program only accepts data from ports in a linear way and not random.

Challenges Faced:  understanding the question.
                  Understanding the router architecture.
                   Understanding socket programming .

Note/Apology :Incomplete assignment .The implementation of threads and select() calls were tried but wasnt succesfull.
              so had to upload the most basic program.it was good learning time though our assignment doesnt reflect our efforts.our lack of prepartion is to be blamed.
